## Q1
#### Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages	

##### What is a 'Markup' Language?

[**Markup languages**][1] is a set of instructions and rules that defines how content is laid out, presented and structured on a web page. This will control over elements on a user's page depending on how it is structured, formatting and how each element is specific and displayed or rendered on a specific web page. 

It is essential as it provides a standardized way to define elements, making it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display correctly.

Example of popular Markup Languages include:
- **HyperText Markup Language (HTML5 or HTML)** - The most common and popular markup language used to create web pages with elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links and more.

For example, below is a paragraph tag used in HTML to display text in a webpage:
>`<p> lorem ipsum </p>`


- **Extensible Markup Language(XML)** - Commonly used for storing and transporting data. The difference with XML is that it allows users to define their own customizable tag catering to the user's unique requirement.

For example, below uses unique naming conventions to describe a list of groceries
>`<groceries> <groceries>Chicken Thighs</groceries> </groceries>`

##### Components and Concepts of Web Development

The concept of a web development markup languages uses a set of structured tags and attributes to define each element and content within a web page which improves assessibility/search engine optimization(SEO), structural layout and content representation. Below are components that are commonly used in web development mark up languages.

1. **Tags**
Tags are used to define elements within a document. They are normally enclosed with angled brackets and as a pair of opening and closing tags. 

For example:

> <h1>this is a HEADER</h1>

    This is a header that is wrapped around between an opening tag of <h1> and a closing tag of </h1>

2. **Attributes**
Attributes are a set of additional values and information about an element. It is usually defined with an opening tag and consists of name and a value/target.

For example:

>`<a href="https://www.thisisalink.com>Link</a>`

    This is an example of an attribute. <a> is the tag and encased within it is the name of the link which is the hyperlink, pairing to = the value/target.

3. **Semantic Markup**
Used primarily within HTML, [semantic markup][2] is used to provide meanings to the content to improve accessibility and search engine optimization(SEO). It helps indicate and clearly describes the meaning of each element to both the browser and a developer. The main benefit of semantic markup is:
<br>
    - **Search Engine Optimization**: by allowing a browser to access and easily understand the contents of a webpage from a header, main body and/or content which is primarily used for SEO principles and practices.
<br>
    - **Accessibility**: enabling users with disabilities to access and interact with your a web page. By having meaning to an element/content, it is easier for users and developers to understand and interpret what each component functionality and representation.

For example:

>`<nav> </nav>`
    
    Defines the content where the navigation list/menu will be located.

>`<header> </header>`

    Defines a header for the webpage that contains a website logo, website name, navigation bar, etc. It is normally located at the top of the page

>`<footer> </footer>`

    Defines a footer for the website that contains information such as contact information, copyright, website author details, etc. It is normally located at the bottom of the screen
